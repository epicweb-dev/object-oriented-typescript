# Interfaces and Classes

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/object-oriented-typescript/2-interfaces-and-classes/intro-to-interfaces-and-classes" />

Interfaces define contracts that classes can implement. They specify what methods
and properties a class must have, without providing the implementation.

```ts
interface Flyable {
	fly(): void
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
	fly(): void {
		console.log('Flying!')
	}
}
```

## Implementing Interfaces

When a class implements an interface, it must provide all required members:

```ts
interface Drawable {
	draw(): void
}

class Circle implements Drawable {
	draw(): void {
		console.log('Drawing a circle')
	}
}
```

## Multiple Interfaces

A class can implement multiple interfaces:

```ts
interface Swimmable {
	swim(): void
}

interface Flyable {
	fly(): void
}

class Duck implements Swimmable, Flyable {
	swim(): void {
		console.log('Swimming')
	}
	fly(): void {
		console.log('Flying')
	}
}
```

## Programming to Abstractions

Use interfaces as types to write flexible code:

```ts
function processAnimal(animal: Flyable) {
	animal.fly() // Works with any class that implements Flyable
}

processAnimal(new Bird())
processAnimal(new Duck())
```

	Interfaces enable polymorphism—you can treat different classes the same way if
	they implement the same interface.

In this exercise, you'll implement interfaces and program to abstractions.
