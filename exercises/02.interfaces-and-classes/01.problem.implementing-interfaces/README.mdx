# Implementing Interfaces

👨‍💼 Let's build a payment system with different payment methods. We'll use
interfaces to ensure all payment methods follow the same contract.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `PaymentMethod` interface with a `pay(amount: number)` method
2. Create a `CreditCard` class that implements `PaymentMethod`
3. Create a `PayPal` class that implements `PaymentMethod`
4. Each class should have its own implementation of `pay()`

💰 Classes that implement an interface must define all its methods.
