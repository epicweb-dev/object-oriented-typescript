# Implementing Interfaces

👨‍💼 Perfect! Both `CreditCard` and `PayPal` implement the same interface, ensuring
they can be used interchangeably.

🦉 The interface defines the contract (`pay()` method), and each class provides
its own implementation. This allows different payment methods to work through the
same interface.

## Interfaces: Classes vs Functions

Interfaces can define contracts for both classes and functions:

```ts
// OOP approach - interface with classes
interface PaymentProcessor {
	process(amount: number): boolean
}
class StripeProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
	process(amount: number) {
		return true
	}
}

// FP approach - function type
type PaymentProcessor = (amount: number) => boolean
const stripeProcessor: PaymentProcessor = (amount) => true
```

Both approaches achieve polymorphism—just through different mechanisms. The OOP
approach bundles state and behavior; the FP approach keeps functions separate
from data.
