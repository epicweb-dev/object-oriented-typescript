# Method Overriding

👨‍💼 Excellent! Each shape now provides its own `getArea()` implementation.

🦉 Method overriding allows subclasses to provide specialized behavior while
maintaining the same method signature. Both `Circle` and `Rectangle` have
`getArea()`, but each calculates the area differently based on its shape.
