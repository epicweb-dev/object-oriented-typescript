# Inheritance

👨‍💼 Great work building class hierarchies with inheritance!

You learned:

- 🔗 **extends** - Create subclasses that inherit from parent classes
- 🔄 **Method overriding** - Subclasses can replace parent methods
- 🔝 **super** - Call parent class methods and constructors
- 📦 **Code reuse** - Inherit fields and methods from parent classes

🦉 Inheritance creates "is-a" relationships:

- A `Dog` is an `Animal`
- A `Circle` is a `Shape`
- Subclasses inherit and can extend parent behavior

💰 Use inheritance when you have a clear hierarchical relationship and want
to share common behavior. Consider composition for "has-a" relationships.
