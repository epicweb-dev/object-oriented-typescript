# Object-Oriented TypeScript 🏛️

👨‍💼 Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming workshop! This workshop focuses
on **encapsulation and polymorphism**, not just syntax.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way to structure code around objects that
combine data and behavior. TypeScript makes OOP powerful with its type system.

We'll cover:

1. **Classes** - Fields, methods, and constructors
2. **Access Modifiers** - public, private, and protected
3. **Interfaces and Classes** - Implementing contracts
4. **Inheritance** - Extending classes and overriding methods
5. **Polymorphism** - Substitutability and why it matters
6. **Composition vs Inheritance** - Practical decision-making

<callout-info>
OOP isn't about using classes everywhere—it's about organizing code so that
complexity is manageable and changes are isolated.
</callout-info>

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Create classes with proper encapsulation
- Use interfaces to define contracts
- Apply inheritance appropriately
- Understand when to prefer composition
- Write polymorphic code that's flexible and testable

Let's build some objects! 🧱
