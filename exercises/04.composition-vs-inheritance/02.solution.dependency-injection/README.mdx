# Dependency Injection

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've demonstrated dependency injection in action.

🦉 Notice how `EmailService` doesn't need to know about `MockLogger` or
`SilentLogger`. It just accepts any `Logger` (or subclass). This is the power
of composition:

- **Testability**: Use `MockLogger` to verify behavior without side effects
- **Flexibility**: Swap implementations at runtime
- **Loose coupling**: `EmailService` doesn't depend on concrete logger classes

💰 Dependency injection is a key benefit of composition. By accepting
dependencies through the constructor (or methods), you make your code more
flexible and testable. This is why composition is often preferred over
inheritance—it gives you more control and flexibility.
