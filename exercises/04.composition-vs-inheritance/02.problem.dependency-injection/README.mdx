# Dependency Injection

👨‍💼 Now let's see the power of composition! We can swap different logger
implementations without changing `EmailService`. This is dependency injection—a
key benefit of composition.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `MockLogger` class that extends `Logger` and stores logs in memory (useful for testing)
2. Create a `SilentLogger` class that extends `Logger` and does nothing (useful for production)
3. Both should extend the `Logger` class from step 01
4. Demonstrate that `EmailService` works with any logger implementation

💰 This is the power of dependency injection: `EmailService` doesn't care which
logger it gets—it just uses whatever logger is provided. This makes testing easy
and allows you to swap implementations at runtime.
