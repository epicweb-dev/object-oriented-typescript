# Composition vs Inheritance

👨‍💼 Excellent work choosing the right approach!

You learned:

- 🔗 **Inheritance** - "is-a" relationships, code reuse through hierarchy
- 🧩 **Object Composition** - "has-a" relationships, combining behaviors
- 🔄 **Function Composition** - combining functions into pipelines (FP style)
- 🎯 **When to use each** - Choose based on the relationship type
- 💡 **Favor composition** - More flexible and easier to change

🦉 Key differences:

- **Inheritance**: Tight coupling, fixed at compile time, "is-a"
- **Composition**: Loose coupling, flexible at runtime, "has-a" or "transforms"

💰 General rule: Use inheritance when you have a clear "is-a" relationship and
want to share implementation. Use composition (object or function) when you need
flexibility.

	OOP is a tool, not a religion. Many successful TypeScript codebases use a mix
	of OOP and functional patterns. Use the right tool for each
	situation—sometimes that's a class, sometimes it's a function, and often it's
	a combination.

Congratulations! You've completed the Object-Oriented TypeScript workshop! You
now understand both OOP patterns and when functional alternatives might be a
better fit.
