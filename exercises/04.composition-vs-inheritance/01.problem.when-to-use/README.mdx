# When to Use Composition vs Inheritance

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/object-oriented-typescript/4-composition-vs-inheritance/when-to-use" />

👨‍💼 Let's build a notification system. We need to decide whether to use
inheritance or composition for different scenarios.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `Logger` class with a `log(message: string)` method
2. Create an `EmailService` class that uses composition (has-a Logger)
3. Create a `FileLogger` class that uses inheritance (is-a Logger)
4. Create a `ConsoleLogger` class that uses inheritance (is-a Logger)
5. Demonstrate when each approach is appropriate

💰 Think about the relationship: Is it "is-a" or "has-a"?
