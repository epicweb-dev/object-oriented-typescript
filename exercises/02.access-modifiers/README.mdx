# Access Modifiers

Access modifiers control the visibility of class members (fields and methods). They
determine what code can access which parts of a class.

```ts
class BankAccount {
	public balance: number // Accessible everywhere
	private accountNumber: string // Only accessible within this class
	protected owner: string // Accessible in this class and subclasses
}
```

## Public (Default)

Public members are accessible from anywhere:

```ts
class User {
	public name: string // 'public' is optional (default)
}

const user = new User()
user.name = 'Alice' // ✅ Can access
```

## Private

Private members are only accessible within the class:

```ts
class BankAccount {
	private accountNumber: string

	constructor(accountNumber: string) {
		this.accountNumber = accountNumber // ✅ Can access inside class
	}
}

const account = new BankAccount('12345')
account.accountNumber // ❌ Error: Property is private
```

## Protected

Protected members are accessible in the class and its subclasses:

```ts
class Animal {
	protected name: string
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	bark(): string {
		return `${this.name} barks!` // ✅ Can access protected member
	}
}
```

	Access modifiers help enforce encapsulation—hiding internal implementation
	details while exposing a clean public interface.

In this exercise, you'll use access modifiers to control visibility.
