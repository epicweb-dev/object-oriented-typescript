# Public and Private

👨‍💼 Let's build a secure user authentication system. We need to protect sensitive
data like passwords while exposing safe methods.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `User` class with public `username` and private `password`
2. Add a public `login()` method that validates the password
3. Ensure the password cannot be accessed directly from outside

💰 Access modifier syntax:

```ts
class User {
	public username: string // Explicitly public
	private password: string // Private - only accessible inside class
}
```

💰 Remember: Private members can only be accessed within the class methods.
