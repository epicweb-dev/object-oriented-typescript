# Protected Access Modifier

👨‍💼 Great! You've used protected to allow inheritance while maintaining
encapsulation.

🦉 Protected is perfect for fields that subclasses need but shouldn't be part of
the public API. `Car` can access `make` and `model` to build its `getInfo()`
method, but external code cannot directly access these fields.
