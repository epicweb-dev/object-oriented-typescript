# Access Modifiers

👨‍💼 Excellent work controlling visibility with access modifiers!

You learned:

- 🔓 **Public** - Accessible everywhere (default)
- 🔒 **Private** - Only accessible within the class
- 🛡️ **Protected** - Accessible in class and subclasses

🦉 Access modifiers are about encapsulation:

- Hide implementation details (private)
- Expose a clean public API
- Allow controlled access in inheritance (protected)

💰 Use private for internal state that shouldn't be modified directly. Use
protected when you want subclasses to access but not external code.
