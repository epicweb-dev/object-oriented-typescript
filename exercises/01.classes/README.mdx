# Classes

Classes combine data (fields) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. They're
templates for creating objects.

```ts
class User {
	name: string
	email: string

	constructor(name: string, email: string) {
		this.name = name
		this.email = email
	}

	greet(): string {
		return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`
	}
}

const user = new User('Alice', 'alice@example.com')
console.log(user.greet()) // "Hello, I'm Alice"
```

## Why Classes?

- **Encapsulation** - Bundle related data and behavior
- **Reusability** - Create multiple instances from one template
- **Type safety** - TypeScript checks field and method types

## TypeScript Shorthand

TypeScript offers a shorthand for constructor parameters:

```ts
class User {
	constructor(
		public name: string,
		public email: string,
	) {}
}
// Automatically creates and assigns this.name and this.email
```

	Classes aren't the only way to organize code. Many modern codebases (React,
	functional libraries) prefer plain objects and functions. This workshop
	teaches OOP as one powerful option—valuable knowledge even if you primarily
	use functional patterns.

In this exercise, you'll create and use classes.
