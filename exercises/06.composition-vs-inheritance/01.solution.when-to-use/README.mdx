# When to Use Composition vs Inheritance

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've demonstrated both patterns correctly.

🦉 Notice the difference:

- **Inheritance** (`FileLogger`, `ConsoleLogger`): These ARE types of loggers.
  They specialize the logging behavior.

- **Composition** (`EmailService`): This HAS a logger but isn't a logger
  itself. It uses logging as a tool. You could swap in different loggers
  without changing EmailService.

💰 `EmailService` could use `FileLogger`, `ConsoleLogger`, or any other
`Logger` implementation. This flexibility is the power of composition.
