# Composition vs Inheritance

Both composition and inheritance are ways to reuse code, but they solve different
problems. Knowing when to use each is crucial for good design.

## Inheritance (Is-A)

Inheritance creates an "is-a" relationship:

```ts
class Animal {
	makeSound(): void {}
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	// Dog IS-A Animal
}
```

Use inheritance when:

- You have a clear hierarchical relationship
- Subclasses are specializations of the parent
- You want to share implementation

## Composition (Has-A)

Composition creates a "has-a" relationship:

```ts
class Engine {
	start(): void {}
}

class Car {
	private engine: Engine // Car HAS-A Engine

	start(): void {
		this.engine.start()
	}
}
```

Use composition when:

- You want flexibility to change behavior at runtime
- You need to combine multiple behaviors
- The relationship is "has-a" not "is-a"

## When to Use Each

**Inheritance:**

- `Dog` is an `Animal` ✅
- `Circle` is a `Shape` ✅
- `Manager` is an `Employee` ✅

**Composition:**

- `Car` has an `Engine` ✅
- `Computer` has a `CPU` ✅
- `User` has a `Profile` ✅

<callout-info>
	Favor composition over inheritance when possible. Composition is more flexible
	and easier to change. Use inheritance when you truly have an "is-a"
	relationship.

In this exercise, you'll choose between composition and inheritance.
