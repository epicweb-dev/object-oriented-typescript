# Composition vs Inheritance

👨‍💼 Excellent work choosing the right approach!

You learned:

- 🔗 **Inheritance** - "is-a" relationships, code reuse through hierarchy
- 🧩 **Composition** - "has-a" relationships, combining behaviors
- 🎯 **When to use each** - Choose based on the relationship type
- 💡 **Favor composition** - More flexible and easier to change

🦉 Key differences:

- **Inheritance**: Tight coupling, fixed at compile time, "is-a"
- **Composition**: Loose coupling, flexible at runtime, "has-a"

💰 General rule: Use inheritance when you have a clear "is-a" relationship and
want to share implementation. Use composition when you need flexibility or have
a "has-a" relationship.

🦉 Both are valuable tools—the key is choosing the right one for each situation.

Congratulations! You've completed the Object-Oriented TypeScript workshop!
