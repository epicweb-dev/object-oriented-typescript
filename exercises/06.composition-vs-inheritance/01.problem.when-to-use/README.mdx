# When to Use Composition vs Inheritance

👨‍💼 Let's build a notification system. We need to decide whether to use
inheritance or composition for different scenarios.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `Logger` class with a `log(message: string)` method
2. Create an `EmailService` class that uses composition (has-a Logger)
3. Create a `FileLogger` class that uses inheritance (is-a Logger)
4. Create a `ConsoleLogger` class that uses inheritance (is-a Logger)
5. Demonstrate when each approach is appropriate

💰 Inheritance (is-a):

- `FileLogger` IS-A `Logger`
- `ConsoleLogger` IS-A `Logger`
- They are specializations of Logger

💰 Composition (has-a):

- `EmailService` HAS-A `Logger`
- EmailService uses logging but isn't a type of logger
- Can swap different loggers at runtime

💰 Think about the relationship: Is it "is-a" or "has-a"?

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
