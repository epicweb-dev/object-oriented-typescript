# Interfaces and Classes

👨‍💼 Excellent work implementing interfaces!

You learned:

- 📋 **Interfaces** define contracts for classes
- ✅ **implements** keyword to fulfill interface requirements
- 🔗 **Multiple interfaces** - classes can implement many interfaces
- 🎯 **Programming to abstractions** - use interfaces as types

🦉 Interfaces vs classes:

- Interfaces define **what** (contract)
- Classes define **how** (implementation)
- Use interfaces for flexibility and polymorphism

💰 Prefer interfaces over concrete classes as parameter types. This makes your
code more flexible and testable.
