# Implementing Interfaces

👨‍💼 Perfect! Both `CreditCard` and `PayPal` implement the same interface, ensuring
they can be used interchangeably.

🦉 The interface defines the contract (`pay()` method), and each class provides
its own implementation. This allows different payment methods to work through the
same interface.
