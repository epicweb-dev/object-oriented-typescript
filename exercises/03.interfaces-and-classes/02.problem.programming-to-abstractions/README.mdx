# Programming to Abstractions

👨‍💼 Now let's write code that works with any class implementing an interface.
This is called "programming to abstractions"—using interfaces instead of
concrete classes.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Use the `PaymentMethod` interface from the previous exercise
2. Create a `PaymentProcessor` class with a method that accepts `PaymentMethod`
3. Write a function that processes payments using the interface type
4. Test with different payment method implementations

💰 Use interfaces as parameter types:

```ts
function processPayment(method: PaymentMethod, amount: number) {
	return method.pay(amount) // Works with any PaymentMethod implementation
}
```

💰 This makes your code flexible—you can add new payment methods without
changing the processor code.
