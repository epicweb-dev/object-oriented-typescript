# Programming to Abstractions

👨‍💼 Excellent! You're now programming to abstractions.

🦉 By using `PaymentMethod` as the parameter type, `processPayment()` works with
any class that implements the interface. You can add new payment methods (like
`BankTransfer` or `Crypto`) without changing the `processPayment()` function.

💰 This is the power of interfaces—they enable polymorphism and make code more
flexible and maintainable.
