# Inheritance and Polymorphism

👨‍💼 Excellent work building class hierarchies and demonstrating polymorphism!

You learned:

- 🔗 **extends** - Create subclasses that inherit from parent classes
- 🔄 **Method overriding** - Subclasses can replace parent methods
- 🔝 **super** - Call parent class methods and constructors
- 📦 **Code reuse** - Inherit fields and methods from parent classes
- 🎭 **Polymorphism** - Treat different types uniformly through base classes
- ✅ **Substitutability** - Subclasses can be used wherever parent classes are expected

🦉 Inheritance creates "is-a" relationships:

- A `Dog` is an `Animal`
- A `Circle` is a `Shape`
- An `AudioFile` is a `MediaFile`
- Subclasses inherit and can extend parent behavior

🦉 Polymorphism enables flexible code:

- Write functions that accept base types
- Automatically work with all subclasses
- Add new types without changing existing code
- The `MediaPlayer` works with any `MediaFile` subclass

💰 Use inheritance when you have a clear hierarchical relationship and want
to share common behavior. Polymorphism makes your code flexible and extensible.
Consider composition for "has-a" relationships.
