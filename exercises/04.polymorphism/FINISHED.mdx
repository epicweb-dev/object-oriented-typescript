# Polymorphism

👨‍💼 Excellent work using polymorphism!

You learned:

- 🔄 **Polymorphism** - Treat different types uniformly
- 🔀 **Substitutability** - Subclasses can replace parent classes
- 🎯 **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Subtypes must be substitutable for
  their base types
- 🔧 **Flexible code** - Write functions that work with base types

🦉 Polymorphism is powerful because:

- You write code once for the base type
- It automatically works with all subtypes
- You can add new types without changing existing code

💰 Use polymorphism when you have a family of related types that share
behavior. This makes your code more flexible and maintainable.
