# Substitutability

👨‍💼 Let's build a media player that can play different types of media files.
We'll use polymorphism to handle all media types uniformly.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `MediaFile` base class with a `play()` method
2. Create `AudioFile` and `VideoFile` classes that extend `MediaFile`
3. Each should override `play()` with its own implementation
4. Create a `MediaPlayer` class with a method that accepts `MediaFile`
5. Demonstrate that both `AudioFile` and `VideoFile` can be used interchangeably

💰 Polymorphism allows you to:

```ts
function playMedia(media: MediaFile) {
	media.play() // Works with MediaFile or any subclass
}

playMedia(new AudioFile()) // ✅ Works
playMedia(new VideoFile()) // ✅ Works
```

💰 The key is using the base class type (`MediaFile`) as the parameter type,
not the specific subclass types.

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
