# Extends

👨‍💼 Let's build a shape hierarchy. We'll create a base `Shape` class and extend
it with specific shapes like `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.ts" /> and:

1. Create a `Shape` base class with a `color` field
2. Create a `Circle` class that extends `Shape`
3. Add a `radius` field to `Circle`
4. Create a `Rectangle` class that extends `Shape`
5. Add `width` and `height` fields to `Rectangle`

💰 Inheritance syntax:

```ts
class Base {
	field: Type
}

class Derived extends Base {
	// Inherits field from Base
	// Can add more fields and methods
}
```

💰 Don't forget to call `super()` in the constructor if the parent has a
constructor.

🐨 Once you've completed the exercise, run `node index.ts` in the playground to test your work!
