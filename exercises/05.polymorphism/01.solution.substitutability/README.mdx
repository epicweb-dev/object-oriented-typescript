# Substitutability

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've demonstrated polymorphism in action.

🦉 Notice how `MediaPlayer.playFile()` accepts `MediaFile` as the parameter
type, but it works with both `AudioFile` and `VideoFile`. This is
substitutability—any subclass can be used wherever the parent class is expected.

💰 This is powerful because you can add new media types (like `ImageFile`) without
changing the `MediaPlayer` code. The player doesn't need to know about specific
types—it just works with the base `MediaFile` type.
