# Object-Oriented TypeScript

👨‍💼 Congratulations! You've completed the Object-Oriented TypeScript workshop!
🎉

You now understand OOP in TypeScript:

- **Classes** encapsulate data and behavior
- **Private fields** (`#`) keep implementation details hidden
- **Interfaces** define contracts classes must fulfill
- **Inheritance** enables code reuse through extension
- **Polymorphism** lets code work with different types
- **Composition** is often better than inheritance

📝 Reflect on what you learned:

- When would you choose a class over plain objects?
- How do interfaces help with testing?
- When should you prefer composition over inheritance?

🦉 **Key insight**: OOP is a tool, not a religion. Use classes when
encapsulation adds value. Use interfaces for flexibility. Prefer composition
for most cases. The goal is maintainable, testable code.

## What's Next?

In the final workshop, **Asynchronous Code, Modules, and Scaling**, you'll
learn about Promises, async/await, modules, and organizing larger codebases.

Keep building! 🏗️
